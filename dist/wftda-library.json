Four of these Skaters are called “$Blockers:blocker$” (together, the $Blockers:blocker$ are called the “$Pack:pack$”), and one is called a “$Jammer:jammer$.” The $Jammer:jammer$ wears a helmet cover with a $star:the-star$ on it.\r\n\r\nThe two $Jammers:jammer$ start each $Jam:jam$ $behind:behind$ the $Pack:pack$, and score a point for every opposing $Blocker:blocker$ they $lap:lapping$, each $lap:lapping$. Because they start $behind:behind$ the $Pack:pack$, they must get through the $Pack:pack$, then all the way around the track to be eligible to score points on opposing $Blockers:blocker$.\r\n\r\nRoller derby is a full-contact sport; however, Skaters cannot use their heads, elbows, forearms, hands, knees, lower legs, or feet to make contact to opponents. Skaters cannot make contact to opponents’ heads, backs, knees, lower legs, or feet.\r\n\r\nPlay that is unsafe or illegal may result in a Skater being assessed a $penalty:penalty$, which is served by $sitting:sitting$ in the $Penalty:penalty$ Box for 30 seconds of $Jam:jam$ time.\r\n\r\nThe team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\r\n\r\nA common $Jam:jam$ might go like this:\r\n\r\n1. $Blockers:blocker$ line up $behind:behind$ the $Pivot:pivot-blocker$ Line and in front of the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n2. $Jammers:jammer$ line up $behind:behind$ the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n3.

The first $Jammer:jammer$ has scored points (up to four), and held their opponent at zero points.
