    "description": "The game of Flat Track Roller Derby is played on a flat, oval track. Play is broken up into two 30-minute periods, and within those periods, into units of play called “Jams,” which last up to two minutes. There are 30 seconds between each Jam.\r\n\r\nDuring a Jam, each team fields up to five Skaters. Four of these Skaters are called “Blockers” (together, the Blockers are called the “Pack”), and one is called a “$Jammer:jammer$.” The $Jammer:jammer$ wears a helmet cover with a star on it.\r\n\r\nThe two $Jammers:jammer$ start each Jam behind the Pack, and score a point for every opposing Blocker they lap, each lap. Because they start behind the Pack, they must get through the Pack, then all the way around the track to be eligible to score points on opposing Blockers.\r\n\r\nRoller derby is a full-contact sport; however, Skaters cannot use their heads, elbows, forearms, hands, knees, lower legs, or feet to make contact to opponents. Skaters cannot make contact to opponents’ heads, backs, knees, lower legs, or feet.\r\n\r\nPlay that is unsafe or illegal may result in a Skater being assessed a penalty, which is served by sitting in the Penalty Box for 30 seconds of Jam time.\r\n\r\nThe team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\r\n\r\nA common Jam might go like this:\r\n\r\n1. Blockers line up behind the Pivot Line and in front of the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n2. $Jammers:jammer$ line up behind the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n3. At the Jam-Starting Whistle, the Blockers skate forward and compete for superior position. The $Jammers:jammer$ skate forward and try to get through the Pack. Each Blocker simultaneously tries to prevent the opposing $Jammer:jammer$ from getting past, and to help their own $Jammer:jammer$ get through.\r\n4. One $Jammer:jammer$ exits the Pack and is declared Lead $Jammer:jammer$, earning the right to end the Jam when they decide. This $Jammer:jammer$ races around the track to get into scoring position.\r\n5. The same $Jammer:jammer$ begins to work their way through the Pack for the second time, and the opposing $Jammer:jammer$ makes their way out of the Pack for the first time.\r\n6. As the second $Jammer:jammer$ to escape the Pack comes around into scoring position, the first $Jammer:jammer$ calls off the Jam.\r\n7. The first $Jammer:jammer$ has scored points (up to four), and held their opponent at zero points. Meanwhile, the opposing $Jammer:jammer$ (by getting into scoring position) held the first $Jammer:jammer$ at only those points, as they could have scored more points on subsequent passes.",
