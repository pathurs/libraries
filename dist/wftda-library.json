Skaters cannot make contact to opponents’ heads, backs, knees, lower legs, or feet.\r\n\r\nPlay that is unsafe or illegal may result in a Skater being assessed a $penalty:penalty$, which is served by $sitting:sitting$ in the $Penalty:penalty$ Box for 30 seconds of $Jam:jam$ time.\r\n\r\nThe team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\r\n\r\nA common $Jam:jam$ might go like this:\r\n\r\n1. Blockers line up $behind:behind$ the $Pivot:pivot-blocker$ Line and in front of the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n2. $Jammers:jammer$ line up $behind:behind$ the $Jammer:jammer$ Line.\r\n3. At the $Jam:jam$-Starting Whistle, the Blockers skate forward and compete for superior position. The $Jammers:jammer$ skate forward and try to get through the $Pack:pack$. Each $Blocker:blocker$ simultaneously tries to prevent the opposing $Jammer:jammer$ from getting past, and to help their own $Jammer:jammer$ get through.\r\n4.

The same $Jammer:jammer$ begins to work their way through the $Pack:pack$ for the second time, and the opposing $Jammer:jammer$ makes their way out of the $Pack:pack$ for the first time.\r\n6. As the second $Jammer:jammer$ to escape the $Pack:pack$ comes around into scoring position, the first $Jammer:jammer$ calls off the $Jam:jam$.\r\n7. The first $Jammer:jammer$ has scored points (up to four), and held their opponent at zero points.
