    "description": "**A team is comprised of Skaters, who must be uniquely identified by a $roster:roster$ number.** Each team must have a jersey of the same base color, such that uniform colors of the two teams playing are of high contrast. $Roster:roster$ numbers must be clearly displayed on a Skaterâ€™s back and upper arm areas. Each team must have helmet covers to clearly indicate who their $Jammer:jammer$ and $Pivot:pivot-blocker$ are. The $Jammer:jammer$ and $Pivot:pivot-blocker$ helmet covers for the two teams must be easy to differentiate.\r\n\r\n**Skaters must wear quad-style roller skates and $protective gear:protective-gear$ during play.** Inline skates are not permitted. $Protective gear:protective-gear$ may not be removed during play. $Protective gear:protective-gear$ may not impair or interfere with the safety or play of other Skaters, support staff, or Officials.\r\n\r\n**Skaters who are injured during play may return to play as long as they are no longer apparently injured or bleeding.** A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game (examples include a $Jam:jam$ being called off, a period clock stoppage, or a $substitute:substitution$ being $seated:sitting$ in the $Penalty:penalty$ Box) may not participate during the following three $Jams:jam$ (extending into the following period if necessary). A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game more than once in a period may not participate as a Skater for the rest of that period. The $Head Referee:head-referee$ may also declare that a team has forfeited the game if that team has five or fewer Skaters eligible to participate, or refuses to field Skaters on the track to continue play.\r\n",
