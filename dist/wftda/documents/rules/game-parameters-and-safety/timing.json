    "description": "**A game lasts for 60 minutes of play, divided into two 30-minute periods with a halftime between them.** Periods are broken into $Jams:jam$, which are the basic unit of play for roller derby.\r\n\r\n**A $Jam:jam$ can last up to two minutes.** $Jams:jam$ may be called off prior to two minutes as part of gameplay, as described below. Each $Jam:jam$ starts with a single short whistle blast, and finishes at the end of a series of four short whistle blasts. At least 30 seconds must elapse between $Jams:jam$. More than 30 seconds may not elapse unless a timeout is called.\r\n\r\n**A period starts on the $Jam:jam$-Starting Whistle of the first $Jam:jam$ for that period.** The period clock does not $stop:stopped$ between $Jams:jam$ unless a timeout is called. If the period clock reaches zero before the next $Jam:jam$ has started, the period ends at that moment; otherwise, the period ends at the conclusion of the final $Jam:jam$ for the period.\r\n\r\nIf a $Jam:jam$ is called off due to officiating discretion (see Section 5.2) or there is an officiating error that potentially impacted the outcome (as in winner/loser) of the game, and there are less than 30 seconds remaining on the period clock at the end of the game (including when the period clock has expired), an additional $Jam:jam$ may be run at the discretion of the $Head Referee:head-referee$. This additional $Jam:jam$ will have the same form (Overtime or not; see Section 1.5.1) as the $Jam:jam$ that ended and be part of the same period.\r\n",
